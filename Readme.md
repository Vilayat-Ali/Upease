# About project ~ Inspiration / Need

During Covid Pandemic, humanity has witnessed a panaroma of destruction and loss of innocent lives. Such mass deaths have totally drove mankind to the state of near lunacy. According to a report published by [kff.org](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/the-implications-of-covid-19-for-mental-health-and-substance-use/) , according to which:

"During the pandemic, about `4 in 10 adults` in the U.S. have reported symptoms of anxiety or depressive disorder."

The same was also found true internationally. According to a report by [WHO.int](https://www.who.int/news/item/05-10-2020-covid-19-disrupting-mental-health-services-in-most-countries-who-survey), which has claimed that: 

"The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted or halted critical mental health services in 93% of countries worldwide while the demand for mental health is increasing"

We, the team AVENGERS know the important of good mental health and how this pandemic can worsen the effect. Hence we made a web application to connect psychiatrists and doctors connect safely to their patients or users, and to bridge the traditional relationship between doctors and patients; Ensuring a systematic and effective treatment.

# Scope

The scope for this project is vast. NGOs and international organisations such as "The Red Cross", "world Health Organization", etc can use this platform to battle mental-health related problems. If enough resources are invested into this project then we are sure that this project can safe millions of lives that are lost in suicides and mental breakdowns.
